    <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl, originally from
        India.
        They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
        junglefowl,
        and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
        cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually
        immature
        female is called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
        eggs)
        or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places.
        Chickens
        domesticated for meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>
